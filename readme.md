Sample code snippets for using the Macromeasures API
----------------------------------------------------

The Macromeasures API provides demographic and psychographic data on Twitter
users. This repository features a simple Python 2.7 script to demonstrate how
the API works. If you don't have the [Requests](http://docs.python-requests.org)
library installed, you can install it by running

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You should edit `get_user_data.py` to use your own API key and replace the
specified Twitter usernames/IDs with the ones you want to look up.

See the [documentation](http://docs-new.macromeasures.com/) for more details.
